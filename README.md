A game similar to breakout written in the Lua programming language using a 2D game engine called [LÖVE](http://love2d.org).

### Why I made this:
  * Videogames are what originally got me interested in programming, so when I was bored over the summer and looking for a fun and low-stress project that I could work on as fast or as slow as I wanted to, a 2D game seemed like a great option. Being able to quickly build and enjoy the core game, and then add small features over time made each coding session feel impactful. At the time, I did not know much about game development, so I did a quick YouTube search and stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k4CMAaNCuk&t=609s) which led me to use the Lua and the LÖVE framework. Enjoy!  
### Current Features:

  * Classic look
  * Easy to play
  * Multiplayer
  * Sound effects
  * More spheres get added over time
  
### Planned Features:

  * Menu system
  * Color mode
  * Power ups
